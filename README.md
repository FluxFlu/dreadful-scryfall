# dreadful-scryfall
A Scryfall clone I made in actual three hours for a Magic: The Gathering format nobody will play.

The format is the same as EDH, except you cannot play cards that are above rank 5000 on EDHREC.

This program is a node.js file that allows you to generate an html webpage, or you can just download the release version, although that will probably be outdated instantly.

Common commands in this program are as follows:

- name
- oracle
- mv
- power
- toughness
- colors
- ids
- type
- is:commander

Potential features:

- Logical operators (AND and OR)
- Other "is" commands
- Forward and back buttons at the bottom of the screen
- Sorting
